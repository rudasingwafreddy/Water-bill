    <b>Water Billing Management System</b> is a system operated by USANASE RUGAMBWA HONOLINE. A Water Billing Management System is one of the latest productivity enhancement tools. To be used widely by WASAC, there is a need for management complaints via operators and analysis by researchers in the field, whether they are made or pending.
    

    <br/><br/>

    Lack of reports movements provides complaint management operations a speed which was never envisaged in manual mode at all. The software allows a booking operator to book and lodge complaints and automatically schedules and prompts operators to source complaints to concerned departments. State-of-the-art management information reports on complaint details and pending complaints with reasons and remarks provide management a better insight into problems and traffic situations of telephone lines. A never-before "Report Wizard" not only allows you to define specific reports on demand but also allows you to define your own sorting and analysis parameters that may be more relevant to you but not programmed by us till now.
